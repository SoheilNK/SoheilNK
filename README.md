I am a student at Get Coding right now. My background is in civil engineering, but I've always been interested in computer science and programming. In my previous jobs, I made spreadsheets for building design, data analysis, and accounting using Visual Basic for Applications in Excel. As a newcomer to Canada, my life and career are about to change, and I'm excited to start programming as a job.
