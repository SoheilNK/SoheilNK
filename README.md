At the moment, I am enrolled at Get Coding. Although I have a degree in civil engineering, computer science and programming have always been areas of keen interest to me. In my prior roles, I frequently used Visual Basic for Applications in Excel to create custom spreadsheets for theÂ design of structures, data analysis, and accounting. Having recently relocated to Canada, I am eager to begin a new chapter of my life as a professional programmer.
