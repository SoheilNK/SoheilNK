After relocating to Canada, I transitioned from a Civil Engineer to a Software Developer. Currently, as an intern at ReliablyME, a Toronto-based startup, I am sharpening my full-stack development skills. I've developed proficiency in Node, React, and TypeScript, along with an understanding of AWS, solidifying my journey in the software development realm. My background ensures a keen eye for detail and strong problem-solving abilities. Fluent in English and French, I'm enthusiastic about tackling challenges and eager to make my mark in the tech world!
