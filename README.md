After moving to Canada, I embarked on an exciting journey and transitioned from civil to programming. As an intern at ReliablyME - a startup based in Toronto - Iâ€™m honing my Full-Stack Software Development skills, adept in Node, React, and TypeScript, and familiar with AWS. My background ensures a keen eye for detail and strong problem-solving abilities. Fluent in English and French, I'm enthusiastic about tackling challenges and eager to make my mark in the tech world!
